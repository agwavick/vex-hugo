**Notifications**  
  
Wearing a smartwatch may be cheating, but it works**.** Your phone will automatically send you notifications of the messages and calls you receive on your phone**.** Instead of picking up your phone, and possibly the tab, you just glance at your wrist**.** Receiving notifications without having to pull out your phone is one of the main benefits of a smartwatch**.**  
  
Other notifications are equally helpful**.** Calendar reminders, office meetings, date nights, and other important reminders also display on smartwatch faces**.** Knowing you’ll be able to catch important notifications when they happen also adds to your peace of mind**.**  
  
**Advanced Monitoring**  
  
Some smartwatches, like the Apple Smartwatch, have advanced tracking tools like an ECG **.** While most smartwatches need to be charged more often than fitness and health trackers, they still provide a wealth of information**.**  
  
**Dieting**  
  
With a little extra effort, your smartwatch can also help with your diet**.** While a smartwatch can’t calculate your macronutrients or help keep you in ketosis, it’ll still provide useful dieting information**.**  
  
**Stress**  
  
Since you have a physiological response to mental state, these trackers are surprisingly accurate**.** That’s a useful tool if you’re trying to increase your health through stress reduction**.** Even if all you can do is take five deep breaths before getting on with your day, you’ll notice your mood improving**.** With that improvement come better health outcomes, better sleep, and greater enjoyment of your free time and hobbies**.**  
  
**Travel**  
  
The GPS in a smartwatch works similarly to your phone**.** The biggest advantage is that you only have to glance at your wrist instead of pulling out your phone**.** If you have Bluetooth headphones, you can even have the watch pipe directions into your ear, just like a phone**.** Anyone can spot a non-local frantically checking their phone for directions to a more familiar location**.**  
  
Getting directions on your watch is simpler, quieter, and less of a neon sign that you’re not from around here**.** Smartwatches mostly use the same navigation systems as similar smartphones**.** An apple watch will produce directions with Siri’s search and map function, just like an iPhone**.** Android and Galaxy smartwatches both use android’s system and google maps, so it’s a similar feature**.**  
  
Still, it’s a little like having a personal guide on your wrist**.** This seems a little counter-intuitive at first glance**.** The real advantage here is that your smartwatch lets you take, and screen, calls without having to pull out your smartphone**.** In order to take advantage of this feature, you’ll need one other piece of equipment, a wireless headset**.**  
  
Much like the notifications making it easier to concentrate and only pause when it’s important, truly hands-free calling makes it easier to multi-task**.** You’ll talk directly into the smartwatch and hear responses the same way**.** We didn’t find this feature as useful as directing calls to a headset since one hand is out of commission every time you need to respond, but it’s still handy for folks who like to walk away from their phone**.**  
  
**Music**  
  
Yes, you can run music through your smartwatch**.** Or, rather, you can run music through your smartphone, and use your smartwatch as a controller**.** If you have named playlists, your smartwatch/smartphone assistant will let you cue up playlists with a spoken command**.** You can even watch YouTube and music videos on your smartwatch, although you may not want to**.**  
  
Apps like Audible aren’t as convenient on a smartwatch, requiring you to press on-screen buttons**.** Plus, if you control your music on your smartwatch, you’re less likely to be distracted by the other apps and social media on your phone**.**  
  
**Saving Your Smartphone Battery**  
  
If you spend a lot of your time on your phone you probably also carry a charger, or a portable battery, with you**.** You worry when your battery dies, you wonder what’s happening that you’ve missed**.** A good smartwatch means you won’t need those things**.** Sure, your phone runs through some battery just being on**.**  
  
You won’t miss notifications, but you’ll also be less inclined to lose minutes and hours scrolling through social media**.** All that combines to mean you use your smartphone less, the battery lasts longer, and you still receive the most important benefits of your phone**.**  
  
**Navigation**  
  
We won’t spend much time here since we’ve already covered something similar, but it’s worth mentioning**.**  
  
**Customization**  
  
This is a little benefit, but one worth thinking about**.** Almost all smartwatches come with a variety of clock faces and other customization opportunities**.** Don’t feel stuck in one theme or background, change them to suit your mood**.**  
  
**Price**  
  
While your average smartwatch isn’t as expensive now as when they were first released, they’re still expensive devices**.** You should expect to pay $200-$400 for a smartwatch**.** Instead of thinking about the dollars by themselves, think about how much the smartwatch is worth to you**.** A smartwatch isn’t like a Rolex**.**  
  
Some can be fashionable, but few smartwatches are designed for form rather than function**.** So, think about the functional features**.** Smartwatches essentially do the same things a smartphone does**.** They can monitor your health a little more accurately, and provide some additional conveniences**.**  
  
**A Fitness Tracker Offers Similar Benefits**  
  
The main additional benefit smartwatches offer over your phone is more accurate health and fitness tracking**.** You can usually get fitness trackers for less than a smartwatch**.** So, if the health benefits are the only appealing feature, we’d recommend a fitness tracker over a smartwatch**.**  
  
**You Have to Charge Them Every Day**  
  
Since a smartwatch is managing more functions, including a larger screen, than a fitness tracker, their batteries don’t last nearly as long**.** While many people think of their smartwatches as an extension of themselves**.** While it may have stress benefits throughout the day, being without your smartwatch is a challenge of its own**.**  
  
**Distraction, Especially for Children**  
  
This is in contrast to the focus benefits you can get from a smartwatch**.** For a different kind of person, the same notifications that are less distracting than a phone will be more distracting**.** A watch is easy to glance at**.** That means that the barrier to checking on social media, apps, appointments, and other distractions is much lower with a smartwatch than a smartphone**.**  
  
For people with full schedules and busy social media feeds, notifications can become constant**.** Even on silent mode, most smartwatches buzz**.** That physical reminder of a notification, a potential distraction, is tempting**.** You’ll likely have at least one embarrassing moment where you thought the smartwatch was silenced when it wasn’t**.**  
  
**Are You Who Smartwatches are Designed For?**  
  
Okay, we’ve talked about the pros and cons of smartwatches**.** Like so much of our modern technology, smartwatches have a specific audience in mind**.** It makes sense since the idea of a smartwatch was almost certainly the brainchild of a business professional**.** They can be helpful for casual users, and certainly, project an aura of tech-savvy and professionalism that can be valuable in some social circles**.**  
  
Just because you don’t fit the profile of the ideal user doesn’t mean you shouldn’t own a smartwatch**.** But it’s an important consideration if you’re trying to decide whether a smartwatch is worth the investment**.**  
  
**Final Thoughts**  
  
We’ve talked about the pros and cons of smartwatches**.** If you think the extra utility is worth it, go for it**.** Hopefully, this article helped clear up any questions or concerns you had about smartwatches**.** But, at the end of the day, the only one who can decide if you should buy a smartwatch is you**.**
